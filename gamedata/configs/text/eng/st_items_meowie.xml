	<string id="nsc_mag_lee_descr">
		<text>
Standard magazine issued with the Colt 1911 Nightsword Custom handgun. This extended 15-round magazine is designed for smooth and reliable feeding, with a reinforced steel body and a low-profile black base plate for quick reloads. It bears a subtle "NSC" marking rather than any commercial logo. Outside the Zone, a single one of these could fetch the price of several surplus pistols, but within the Zone its worth is judged solely by its practicality making it valuable only to those who carry the Nightsword.		</text>
